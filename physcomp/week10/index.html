    <h4>Working on the Final</h4>
<p>I've started planning / working on my final project, which is going to a VJ device &amp; Visualizer website
combination. There two parts to executing this, which would be physically building the box and connecting it to the arduino /
setting up serial communication, and making the website with stand alone visuals.</p>

<p>I've mostly worked out the components of the box: 4 potentiometers for framerate, speed, and 2 hues; 4 sliders for 2 saturations and 2 brightnesses; 10 buttons, one for a camera, and 9 for added effects.
It took me a while to come to this conclusion, and it's definitely not set in stone. I won't settle it until I finish the 2-3 visualization options, because the usability of the components really depends on what the visual options attached to them are.
I do plan to have a 10x14 inch box, or smaller. I'll probably paint it to look aesthetically similar to the website. I was considering using an interesting acrylic for laser cutting, but the one I want would cost a good amount. I don't want to spend too much money on this project, as I'm not flush with cash at the moment.
I've been working on two different visual sketches currently; <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/aA7Suir-g">soundStorm</a> &amp; <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/nL5Cfv6Oi">soundWaves</a>. They aren't complete, I still need to change the colorMode of both to HSB
as well as create 2-3 more stand alone effect functions that could be dropped into any sketch.
<br><br>
The website itself will be fairly easy to make on Glitch. I'd like to have a home page, instructables / documentation page, and 2-3 visual pages. I'm still thinking about how to have some sort of
real time music interaction, like the ability to put on a playlist and have the sketch react, but for now I'm just uploading mp3 files. That will be something I save for last, because it doesn't impact presentation.</p>
