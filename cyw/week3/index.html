<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://olivia-em.github.io/codeyourway/encode/encode6/index.html">Encode 2.1</a></h5>
<p>This first one was pretty easy to understand, because I've made grids before in p5. As I do the encode process more, I'm realizing that I understand how code works
more than I can rewrite it verbatim. For example, I can't replicate the exact dimensioning in my head, but I know it's something proportional to the window. Or, I know of a way to do something
but then the code uses a different way to achieve a similar effect to what I had in my head.</p>
<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://olivia-em.github.io/codeyourway/encode/encode7/index.html">Encode 2.2</a></h5>
<p>Similarly here, I thought that the code was just drawing three rectangles in an x-position for-loop, but instead it was working like the grid in the first example, taking into account y-position.
Between the encoding and decoding, I find decoding the most fun but encoding is more useful because I'm beginning to systematically understand how to recreate art that I like with code.</p>

<p>I didn't really struggle with understanding these two sketches because they are a lot like 1. the sketch I made last week and 2. a patternmaker I made in ICM last semester. I repurposed one of my sketches
from last week that also used createGraphic to fill in the half circles for 2.2.</p>
<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://olivia-em.github.io/codeyourway/recode/recode3/index.html">Recode 2.1</a></h5>
<p>It was really refreshing to see Vera Molnar's piece <i>De La Serie (Des) Ordres</i> from the slides and know exactly how I'd code it. It was really quick, especially using Decode 2.1 as a framework.</p>
<h5><a target="_blank" href="https://olivia-em.github.io/codeyourway/recode/recode4/index.html">Recode 2.2</a></h5>
<p>After using Github Copilot, I feel a lot better about my understanding of code. I wanted the designs to swap places, and when I gave my initial few prompts, it just kept giving me code that didn't work.
When I would ask it to change things, it just wrote more functions that also didn't do what I visually wanted to do. However, I knew a better way of structuring the code / a different method and eventually had the AI start from scratch
and gave it prompted for specifically that method. I was sort of testing the AI to see if it would try different methods on its own after I said something wasn't working, but very often it wouldn't change much and
gave me code that didn't work or didn't even adhere to my prompts in the strictest sense. I can definitely see how AI needs to be used by people who understand what they want and know how to ask for it. I'm fairly confident that I could have achieved
what the AI did, but it definitely would have taken me significantly more time. As of right now, I think I prefer Chat GPT over Github Copilot because I think it's better at adapting when things aren't working. I wouldn't say I was tempted to use
AI otherwise this week, but that is probably because everything I wanted to do was either something I knew how to do already or (more often) I tend to tinker with sketches until I get something I like, rather than having a specific idea. Usually I just think: What if this moved? What if the colors
were different? What if I added another shape? I like this part of the creative coding process the most, and I like being pleasantly surprised with what I've created. I think I would have been more tempted to use AI if I had outcomes that I needed to happen / constraints that I didn't know how to replicate. For example,
having to recreate a complicated sketch from scratch just by looking at it without either doing any research or using old code I have as a framework.</p>
