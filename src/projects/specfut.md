Once we had filmed some of our content separately, we went back to the drawing board to simplify our theme. We knew if would be a big ask to get a lot of people to film 
for our project. I had thrown an idea around about a girl on her walk home. This developed from "what if she felt safe?" to "how can the simplest of journeys feel like the greatest endeavor?"
