#### Brainstorming & Working with AI

Ok this project was a huge hurdle for me. I had a lot of ideas about where to go and what I thought AI could help me with.
I made a <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1CHVRG58A4EUSaQRIZiYXP?si=66019eb4ac9e4958">playlist</a> for inspiration.
However, I was kind of disappointed with what AI had to give me. I had gotten inspiration pictures from pinterest and wanted to see what it could
do with them. The videos that came out were bizarre, soulless, flat, or all three.

I had originally wanted to do something that took a person through someone's quasi-living instagram, where all the pictures would come to life.
I still wanted the video to retain aesthetic and artistry. I don't take the comedy route for projects very often, and I wasn't confident doing that here.
I wouldn't say that artistry and depth lend well to AI, and I was consistently unhappy with the content I creating. I used all 2,500ish credits for text to image generation in Runway
and I didn't use a single one of those images in my final project.

I decided I wanted to do a cross between poetry and AI art, either using my own poetry or some writers I like. My poetry 
can be a bit gruesome, so I ended up not going that way, especially because AI doesn't do gore very well

  We had a lot of footage, so we selected a portion that felt right and made a plan to divide the work and come back together 
  a couple days later. We also decided that some text, like internal monologue, could be interesting.

#### Editing

We knew we wanted the final cut to be a bit abstract, with jumpcuts, flashes, a mix of stills and videos, and high color contrast. We edited a bunch of clips separately, and then came back together
to make a final product. We started by doing an audio cut, because we knew that the video would follow musical cues. Devan recorded a voiceover which would
bookend the music. It was at that point we decided that we had two characters, a girl on an emotional journey and a caller trying to connect.

  After we finished the audio, we spent probably two days in After Effects. We lost a couple hours on Monday because some clips weren't properly backed up
  and we had to remake them (always triple check you have your content in three places kids). We cut the music down again because we felt like we may not have time to finish. 
  In the end we didn't save much time, but the video did have a better flow because of it.

#### Execution

I'm so proud of our finished video for a lot of reasons. Devan and I worked really hard, and no matter
what we made, I was always going to be proud of that. But the cherry on top is that this film is really in line with my goals as a creator.
I'm really interested in reflective or contemplative pieces that are emotionally charged but remain more conceptual
rather than following a strict narrative.
