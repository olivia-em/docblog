#### Brainstorming

Kalinda and I originally wanted to use non-tactile sensors, like audio and ultrasonic, to change a p5.js visualization. We found a couple websites for 
documentation, and tried to follow those labs, but struggled to get them to work. We think we had a problem with voltage, but we were also having some technical 
difficulties with the serial connection to the laptop we were using. With all the other midterms that we both had going on, we thought it would be better to scale back,
since we also had to learn how to do the code for connecting arduino to p5.js. In the end, we decided to stick with buttons and potentiometers and create a small
VJ-ing set up.
