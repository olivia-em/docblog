#### Brainstorming

Taegen ran a couple of ideas by me for this project that really focused on movement. He mentioned a seed sprouting into a tree, and I thought
that would make a good loop because it was inherently about a life cycle. We agreed to use objects around the ITP floor, like PComp materials and stuff from the
junk shelf. I was out of town for the weekend, so we got together on Monday to experiment and film.

#### Filming

We rummaged and found some cool materials, like LEDs, buttons, a bag of leaves, wires, and some cardbaord. Taegen had some preliminary
sketches of a seed in a pot, so we started from there. We struggled to find good lighting, so we transitioned from an open table to one of
the private rooms. I'm still not super happy about how dark the video is, but neihter of realized it would be a problem until editing everything together.

#### Execution

Our loop is a little choppy and dark, but overall I'm happy with what we made considering I've never really done it before with physical items
rather than images in After Effects. Taegen added some cool designs in Procreate as well, which I think made it pop more.
