I was really interested in hypertext as a way of connecting objects, like web pages, and I especially loved the diagram behind those linkages. For my final project, I knew I wanted to do some sort fo poetic composition
that has a narrative throughline, but also plays with the idea of perspective and the relation between past and present. Initially, I was going to do some sort of installation with prijection mapping into photo frames on the wall, 
but I ultimately wanted to use this project for Code Your Way and Computational Approaches to Narrative. Then I came to the idea of 3D website that visualizes, in some way, a diagram with unexpected connections. I was working with parametric equations
as I liked how they have the same variable affecting different aspects of the code, such that each part is related to one another, and I thought this melded well with the concept I had. At the time, I knew what I wanted to write about, and much of the writing process
was therapeutic.

This was my initial project plan, in which there would be some sort of main text in 3D page, and then zooming out would reveal subtexts. My first proof of concept was a basic Three.js page with two cubes. The user could rotate either cube individually or rotate the scene
as a whole. Once I got that working, I knew I could achieve an expanded version. 

#### [Writing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZ2nN5u5q2l1qOvAAPWlnl6e6UL9sjyc2AEvdsX9_FM/edit?usp=sharing)

I wrote from personal experience, so I started by just dumping a lot of stuff on the page. The main text is broken into 5 sections, which are about 5 confrontations that came over the course of being involved with a person. 
Each situation relates to a subtext, a short prose excerpt about a person from the past who treated me similarly. Going into the writing, I really felt like these connections meant I should have known better at the time. However, 
as I wrote I realize that this process is what allowed me to understand the connections, just really sitting down to think through the past and try to see something from many angles. So I think the content strays away from that initial idea of
