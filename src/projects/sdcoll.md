#### Brainstorming

##### Week #1

In the next two weeks, Justin, Vedang, and I will be working on this first project. We've talked about doing the option where we imagine a sound installation.
Vedang brought up focusing on environments that are supposed to be quiet, like museums, galleries, libraries, or the quiet car of a train. I've been brainstorming, and
I think it would be cool to create a version of one of those places. Instead of the audience using the space to look at paintings or read a book, they need to think about how these
aren't actually silent spaces. They may be quiet, but there is still some sort of spatial noise that is affecting the experience. How does the spatial noise change the way you inhabit a space? Maybe we could compare a gallery
when it is empty vs. highly trafficked. Or we could create two separate rooms with a different kind of 'silent space' in each, and then switch the spatial noise. Now the library sounds like the quiet car of a train, and vice versa.
Does that change the way the audience inhabits the space? I'll bring this up when I talk to them next!

##### Week #2

As a group, we decided to combine both Option B (creating new sounds for a preexisting system) and Option C (design a sound installation) for our project. We thought a bathroom tour, where the sounds are replaced with
