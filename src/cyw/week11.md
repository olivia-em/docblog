#### Project Development: Final Steps

<br>

##### Progress: 

I’ve written the poetry and created its 3D layout with interactions, and I’ve launched the app. I think I've done the majority of my project, and now I just have 
to fine tune. 

##### Two-Week Timeline:
I want to make an ‘about the author’ page and hide it like an easter egg. I also want to smooth out some of the interactions.
