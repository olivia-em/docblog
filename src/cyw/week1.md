I was surprised by how helpful this encode process was. For this first one, I could tell that all of the shapes/dimensions were proportional
to one another, but I wasn't really sure how it was coded. Once I understood that, all of the other examples were easier to understand, because
they had a simple structure that I could understand, but played with a couple concepts I hadn't used much, like trigonometry and proportional dimensions.
After this first one, I decided that while remvamping each sketch, I wanted them to be thematically similar. So once I got a color changing loop working (which was
something I had learned for ICM last semester, I reused it while also playing with other aspects. Stylistically, I love blending modes A LOT, especially difference, so I carried that through
as well.

For this one, I totally understood the mechanics without seeing the code, because we had worked on this in ICM. However, I didn't know you could use 
trigonometry to create a dynamic speed. It took me a while to comment out certin things and work the code backward to understand how
