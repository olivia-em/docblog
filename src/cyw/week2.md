For this sketch, I had a pretty good idea of what it would look like initially. Or rather, conceptually I understood
how the randomness would change the positioning slightly. I wasn't sure how much overlap there would be exactly, but I knew it 
would be there. Initially I thought this sketch would have the limits of the range increasing with the width 
of the squares, but that wasn't the case. So, for my edits, I made it that way. I also added random color and made it a circle instead of 
a square.

Similarly, I knew what this one was going to look like mostly. My sketch isn't as accurate as my description in the notes. 
For my edits, I wanted more of the rectangles to be vertical, so I changed the if-statement. I also added an ellipse on top and 
random color.

OKAY, so this one got a little crazy. I spent WAY too much time on it. I new what it was going to look like sort of. I thought there would
be more of a padding, but then I realized only the starting points were limited, rather than the end points as well. I initially changed the lines
to multiple <a target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/curveVertex/">curves</a>. Then, I wanted the padding to shaped them into a circle like 
a ball of yarn. After adding fill, I noticed it was looking like a kaleidoscope, so I tried to replicate that by using <a target="_blank" href="https://editor.p5js.org/allison.parrish/sketches/kOHWUvQR1">mask image</a>
to mask the pattern into a circle.
