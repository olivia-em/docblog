This was an assignment in ICM during our unit on pixels. I really enjoyed making it and mostly enjoyed the result. However, I wasn't necessarily prioritizing clarity
in the code, so I wanted to work on making the variable names more clear. Also, I didn't like that the pixels wouldn't show up as squares in fullscreen, because the rectangles had a different width
and height that was proportional to the window. I also wanted the video to always be the full window, as it will be living on my github pages, rather than in the p5 editor. Lastly, I wanted the text to show up in front of the pixels. 
I definitely used chatGPT, especially for the grid update and getting the text to appear in front. I don't think I would have thought about storing positions, then reapplying them after the loop, so I feel like I learned a new technique. 

I'm really happy that I had the chance to come back around to this, because I always felt like it had potential but I haven't really had the time to circle back. Now I have some ideas about how I could use it for poetry related art.
