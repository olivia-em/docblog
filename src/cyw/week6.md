I was in a little bit of a rut with these ones at first, but by the end I was really into some of them. Explore 4 and 5, as well as the 
screensaver were my favorites. I would definitely say that chatGPT helped a lot this week, but I had a very clear vision for how I wanted things
and had to go back and forth with AI, then edit the code myself for a while, then maybe go back again to repeat the cycle. Stylistically, I think I like the 
sketches that look like lights the most, and the 3D aspect is super fun as well. 

As for github, I already had a repository for this class, and I typically use github desktop to update the repo with different versions. I think I'll have to take some time to get used to using the 
command line instead.
