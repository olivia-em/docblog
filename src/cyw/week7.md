I kind of took it easy over spring break, since I made my hello world prototype for the proposal. I've been taking time to research and do the writing portion of my project. 
I also thought a lot about the specific visuals and animations I plan to make for each section of the writing. I also messed with some text in WEBGL so I could think about scale and amount of content. I checked out a concrete poetry book to get some inspiration as well.
