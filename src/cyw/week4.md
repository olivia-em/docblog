So I wanted to try some 3D stuff this week, and I thought this sketch would be cool to add z-axis dimensions. I did you chatGPT
to help me with necessar structure because I've never used webGL before. The one big issue I faced with this sketch and the other 3D one is 
translating & rotation. I got really confused with how to translate to differently affect small parts and then also creating perspective and an origin of orbit. 
This will come with practice and research I think.

For this sketch, I used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3_eUixh89I">this</a> video & code as guidance. I struggled to visualize this one initially because I'm struggling with the concept of noise and 
how it mathematically affects other variables. I struggled to create an axis of orbit, but I would have liked to have the visual to rotate about the x-axis.

I was mostly just playing around with this one, but again, placing translation & rotation combinations in the code was really hard. I think I need to practice that moving forward.

I want to do more art with gradients, but not just doing rainbow palettes. So I found these references to go off of : <a target="_blank" href="https://editor.p5js.org/p5/sketches/Color:_Radial_Gradient">radial gradients</a> & <a target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/lerpColor/"> lerpColor</a>.
