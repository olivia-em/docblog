This first one was pretty easy to understand, because I've made grids before in p5. As I do the encode process more, I'm realizing that I understand how code works
more than I can rewrite it verbatim. For example, I can't replicate the exact dimensioning in my head, but I know it's something proportional to the window. Or, I know of a way to do something
but then the code uses a different way to achieve a similar effect to what I had in my head.

Similarly here, I thought that the code was just drawing three rectangles in an x-position for-loop, but instead it was working like the grid in the first example, taking into account y-position. 
Between the encoding and decoding, I find decoding the most fun but encoding is more useful because I'm beginning to systematically understand how to recreate art that I like with code.

I didn't really struggle with understanding these two sketches because they are a lot like 1. the sketch I made last week and 2. a patternmaker I made in ICM last semester. I repurposed one of my sketches
from last week that also used createGraphic to fill in the half circles for 2.2.

It was really refreshing to see a piece from the slides and know exactly how to code it. It was really quick, especially using Decode 2.1 as a framework.

After using Github Copilot, I feel a lot better about my understanding of code. I wanted the designs to swap places, and when I gave my initial few prompts, it just kept giving me code that didn't work. 
When I would ask it to change things, it just wrote more functions that also didn't do what I visually wanted to do. However, I knew a better way of structuring the code / a different method and eventually had the AI start from scratch 
and gave it prompted for specifically that method. I was sort of testing the AI to see if it would try different methods on its own after I said something wasn't working, but very often it wouldn't change much and 
gave me code that didn't work or didn't even adhere to my prompts in the strictest sense. I can definitely see how AI needs to be used by people who understand what they want and know how to ask for it.
