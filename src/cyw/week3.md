This first one was pretty easy to understand, because I've made grids before in p5. As I do the encode process more, I'm realizing that I understand how code works
more than I can rewrite it verbatim. For example, I can't replicate the exact dimensioning in my head, but I know it's something proportional to the window. Or, I know of a way to do something
but then the code uses a different way to achieve a similar effect to what I had in my head.

Similarly here, I thought that the code was just drawing three rectangles in an x-position for-loop, but instead it was working like the grid in the first example, taking into account y-position. 
Between the encoding and decoding, I find decoding the most fun but encoding is more useful because I'm beginning to systematically understand how to recreate art that I like with code.

I didn't really struggle with understanding these two sketches because they are a lot like 1. the sketch I made last

So for this one, I understood conceptually what was happening, but I didn't realize the lines draw would be 
so much smaller. Therefore, I didn't realize the line would be very smooth. I added noise to change the color. 
However, I don't fully understand why the gradient seems to be across the canvas rather than following the line. I thought it looked cool;
a happy accident.

Doing this assignment was really tough because noise is so hard on my computing power. I accidentally made my app storage overload
because I had it looping in a non-optimized fashion. I also wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. I want to get into glitch art
so I thought I could have noise change a bunch of grid squares, like pixels. But, I kinda got lost in the sauce 
for a while, and nothing I did really made me happy. I ended up with this; not really sure how I got here. I just kept changing variables and 
adding functions until I thought it looked cool.
