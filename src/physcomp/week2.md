#### Labs

I felt way more comfortable working on this week's labs, becuase I had a better understanding of circuits once we had class. Seeing an llustration of the relationship between
voltage, resistance, and current really helped me understand those concepts more. I do really well having the diagrams in the labs, but I definitley worry that I wouldn't be able 
recreate a circuit without that help, so that's something I want to work on moving forward. I did have a couple mishaps; I miswired the potentiometer and it started smoking a little bit.
I didn't realize that the outside prongs had to be the ones connected to power and ground, so that was my mistake there. I also stabbed myself with a wire at some point, so I was bleeding a bit. Funnily enough, I burned myself
