#### Review Worksheet

I feel mostly good about this week's review worksheet. I think my circuit drawings are correct, and I know my code is right because I checked it with the arduino. 
I'd definitely like to go over the difference between digital and analog sensors in class. I understand some of the differences in characteristics, like how analog sensors are continuous. 
But I don't really understand why digital sensors aren't continuous, and I'd like more clarification on use cases.

#### Labs

These labs were super fun to execute because they provided some inspiration for future projects. I don't necessarily have any questions about them right now.
