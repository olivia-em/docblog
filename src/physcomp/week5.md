#### High Current Loads

After going through the assignment materials, I do have a few questions.

Why is it better to use a transistor instead of a relay when powering a a DC motor, if 


#### Readings

##### <i>Making Things Move,</i> Dustyn Roberts

It took me a little bit by surprise to see that my readings for the week were written by Dustyn Roberts, because I took her class, <i>Intro to Mechanical Design,</i>
during my last semester of undergrad. After reading the two chapters of her book, I would definitely say that she's pretty consistent with what she writes and how she teaches. 
In that class, we learned how to use SOLIDWORKS to make 3D and 2D models for printing/laser cutting. One of the most important things I learned was the anecdote of measuring twice, cutting once; this
is especially true for getting tolerance correct and adjusting for kerf. These two things, in regards to 3D printing and laser cutting respectively, are super important and not 
always known or easily understood. From my experience in laser cutting, kerf takes about 0.07mm(?) on either side of a line, which can really affect the fit of parts when you're trying to put things 
together. This is especially the case when you want to fasten with a press fit joint. For 3D printing, especially with lower resolution, faster prints in PLA, there will be significant shrinkage for holes 
and expansion for posts. I digress, the emphasis on the lack of precision in measurements is really important to understand when trying to rapid prototype, and would definitely be the thing I adjust for time-wise. 
You absolutely cannot expect your first design to do what you want it to, even if your models are "precise and accurate."
