#### Serial Communication

This was very similar to my midterm project, so I didn't have too much trouble getting everything together.

#### Final Project Ideas

I've been thinking about what I'm going to do for my final project, and I think I just want to do a larger scale
version of my midterm (VJ device). I'd like to have a bigger interface with more / nicer options, maybe sliders and bigger buttons that are more sensitive to touch. Rather than working in RGB, I'd like
to change the color mode to HSB, so it's easier to get the color you want. I'd also like to change the visualization to be more dynamic and, in some ways, reacts to music in real time on its own.
This is a bit grand, but having a website with options for visualization types would also be cool. I think this is a good way to maybe combine my pcomp and ICM finals, so I can really dive in to the project.
