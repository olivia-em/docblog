#### Sound & Space: Setting & Space

##### On the Rights of the Molotov Man

This is one of the first times I have read an article where two sides of a discussion are genuinely put side by side.
I have read written dialogues between academics disagreeing, but it's usually in the form of publishing separately. I appreciated the way this article was
framed; the two ends were so well put that I found myself agreeing in some ways with both. Do I think that one person can own imagery into eternity... no. That's not how things have worked
historically. An image can become iconic or a motif and have an afterlife which outlasts the artist. But, I don't think that's what Meiselas had in mind anyway. Meiselas's methodology is more aligned with a
historian's. Context is the most important thing for historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists. Garnett recreates the image not only without providing some sort of historical background, but the image itself is incomplete. 
Honestly, I feel like Garnett's purpose would still have been achieved 

##### Project One: Collecting Sounds
