#### Intro to Storytelling / Sound & Space

After watching Pauline Oliveros's talk on hearing vs. listening, I latched on to a few things.
Listening, as opposed to hearing, requires the effort to understand. However, that understanding looks different depending on the sound.
Spacial noise, like the sound of ventilation in a room, doesn't require the same 'listening' as sound that is purposefully intended to communicate.
Maybe you sit in silence for a few minutes, listening to the spacial noise around you. This kind of listening could bring an understanding of how you are situated in space, focusing
on your body / the physical world. But, I wouldn't say that ventilation or a creaking house are trying to communicate some sort of message. It can make you feel an emotion or invoke an idea, but 
that relationship is between you and the sound itself. For sound that is created with intention (language, music, a knock on the door), I think there is now a different layer. The relationship is between you, the sound, and the entity creating it.
Your understanding is no longer just about how the sound makes you feel or what it makes you think of, you also have to seek out the intention behind it.
