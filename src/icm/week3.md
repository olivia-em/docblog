#### Creating My [PoolSlider](https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/OmTgEU4u5)

I had an idea to make a slider that was sort of game adjacent, and I wanted it to move more that just side to side. Originally,
I was going to have a ball move in a triangular shape, but constraining the ball movement within a triangualr geometry was a little confusing
for me. Then, I thought it would be just as cool to actually make a pool table for the ball to move around on. I struggled to get the ball
to drag for a while.
