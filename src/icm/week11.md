#### My (and Michael's) [RUdaft?(punkhands)](https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/F0KI4rxeMH)

<br>

We had just done p5 play in class, and even though the assignment was to make an instrument or composition, we wanted to make more of a game with
instrumental aspects. Michael brought up the Daft Punk sound bites. We were going to do something with that, but when I realized it wouldn't be able to make that many
good combinations, I was thinking what if it were a game instead. From there, we made this guy. Stylistically, it makes me think of [geometry dash](https://www.google.com/search?q=geometry+dash&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYjwIyBwgAEAAYjwIyEggBEC4YQxiDARixAxiABBiKBTINCAIQABiDARixAxiABDIVCAMQLhhDGIMBGNQCGLEDGIAEGIoFMhUIBBAuGEMYgwEY1AIYsQMYgAQYigUyGwgFEC4YQxiDARiLAxiZAxioAxixAxiABBiKBTIQCAYQABiDARiLAxixAxiABDIVCAcQABhDGIMBGIsDGLEDGIAEGIoFMhIICBAuGEMYgwEYsQMYgAQYigXSAQg0MDkzajFqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&si=ACC90nxka2Fvqm8pF4Tj4sQ1t1xOqFa-vXa7u_yINfUbY02ybk4u16krE5AzXwUuKc-JlFCNNjkK6fD6Sh-HQNFeOWxcU9hYL_449OIb0A_ul5Ve4_BdK6c%3D&ictx=1&ved=2ahUKEwjnir_c7O2JAxUHF1kFHUYCDU0Q_coHegQIKhAd).

Basically, the game is two-player (although it's possible to play by yourself), and you have to hit the platforms within a certain timing in order to win. Once you satisfy the win-conditions,
the Kanye West song <i>Stronger</i> plays.
