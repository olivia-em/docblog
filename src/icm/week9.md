#### My (and Michael's) [PIXELSproject](https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/zn_hQw3Uj) & [PIXELSproject 2.0](https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/hzMPd6IpS)
<br> 

Originally, Michael and I wanted to do what I think is pixel moshing?? IDK exactly, but it's using the colors of one video, but the movement of another
to change those pixels. After diving into it and getting two webcams, trying to connect those, and trying to get the code to come together, we realized it wasn't
totally feasible. The most difficult part was in realizing that p5.js can't run two videos simultaneously, it would be difficult to get the pixel data of video, store it and then get the pixel data of another
video immediately afterwards. We definitely think this is possible in general, but we didn't have the time to execute it.

<br> 

Michael had worked on a cool ASCII pixel video, and I wanted to incorporate that into our project. We made it so that
the keycode of what your typing changing the color ramps of the video as you type along. We added an input field (although it's not necessary to changing colors), so that the most recent key typed will
then appear on random pixels. A clear button sets the input field's values back to nothing. In the 2.0 version, I changed the code so that whatever you type appears on the random pixels.
