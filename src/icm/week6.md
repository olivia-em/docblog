#### Breaking down my [patternMaker](https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/4mGfqYalI)

I decided to rework my patternMaker to make it simpler and add functionality. It used to use quite a lot of arrays, but the sheer amount of them was actually
unecessary, especially when I made the design into a portable function. I also tried to use a class/object system and I sort of got it to work, but it really
slowed down the p5 editor until it was unresponsive. This is the [failed version](https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/QlAGfCUIF).
Since the code is pretty complicated to look at no matter how much you simplify the original while keeping the output the same, I also made a [basic version](https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/LK4tmiHdg)
that I'll use to demo the nested for loop.
