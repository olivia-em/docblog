#### Watch, Read, Run Code

I've realized throughout this week's assignments that I learn so much just by lollygagging around the internet trying to find code
that works for the problem I have, however it is incredibly time consuming. I have ideas that I struggle to execute on my own, so I look for different solutions
in various forums or documentation pages. This is definitely obvious and true for a lot of people. Still, I'm always collecting code from people and building on it, especially
complex functions. I'm not yet at the stage where the syntax is so clear to me that I can create these things on my own. I hope it'll click for me eventually, but I'm 
happy that I'm at a place of understanding where I can experiment and deconstruct in order to get the results I want. The worksheet for this week was fun to complete and really tested my ability 
to iterate on and abandon ideas that don't work. 

#### Creating My [AnimatedSketch](https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/Nm11vqA10)

I created a primitive color changing and interactive ipod for the animated sketch. This was the first idea that came to me and I just rolled with it. I know 
that I take a lot of time to code these pieces so I just wanted to dive in. The three requirements were having something that changes based on the mouse, over time, and upon running the sketch. 
Since I was making a device, it seemed self explanatory that the button would dictate a change when the mouse was clicked it. I also thought it would be cute for the ipod to change color every time you ran the sketch.
I didn't come up with the idea for the change over time until very last, because I knew it would take the least amount fo time to implement. I like to build everything from the ground up, so I designed the sketch without the animations first. 
I ran into some issues when I translated the coordinate system, and had to keep using <i>resetMatrix()</i> in order to make the curves of the headphones. So in the end, I backtracked to get rid of the translation altogther. 
Making the gradient was difficult also, to the point that I don't know if I could explain why some of the code works the way it does.
