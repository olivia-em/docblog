#### How does CM apply to my interests?

I would say that computational media, working with HTML / CSS / p5.js was my introduction
to interactive media in general. It's what I'm most comfortabe with. My background is in literature, history,
and translation. So, when I was just starting off with web design related things, it was more my hobby than my academic focus. 
It was how I played with my creativity in a way that I hadn't been able to before. Not only is the process of coding very therapeutic for me (it reminds me of translation), but what
I'm doing is usually something that is related back to concepts of self-expression. I'm a big user of Pinterest, which is an entire app almost dedicated to mindful creation of the self.
I read a lot of Anne Carson and Sylvia Plath, so I like melodramatic poetry and prose, and that's the type of stuff I write as well.
