First, I'm really loving tracery.js. I wanted to explore it's constant generation as a way to animate text and direct the reader's attention, rather than
making a way to generate different one-off stories. The switching also represents how fast thoughts / memories can shoot through your mind and often re/cycle.
When I write, I often have a lot of one-off lines that could be switched out with others, so this was fun way to repurpose them.

I know it's not exactly a narrative, but I was more excited how the functioning & limitations of tracery (as a word generation library) could help communicate what it feels
like to hold on to the things people have (or haven't) said.
