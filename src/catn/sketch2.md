In another class, I was working on a command line scavenger hunt where you traverse a folder through the terminal. The structure I 
created for that sort of informed this project (or vice versa, because I was sort of working on them at the same time). I wanted to have a narrative where you 
have some choices, and then you have to move through a side cycle before moving forward again. This made me think of a forest path, where you can choose a direction and then you have to explore to find your way out. 
In fact, a forest walk was my theme for the scavenger hunt, BUT for this Twine game, I wanted to incorporate poetry about love. That structure of living through 
a cycle until you've exhausted yourself, then finding a way out, can be mapped to bad or incompatible love.

I was inspired by Anne Carson's <i>Eros the Bittersweet</i>, and pulled content from there, as well as other writers and my own poetry. The way I placed content
was based on themes: lover, beloved, beautiful, and foiled. The cycles you chose to enter determine the final piece of writing you received (four outcomes). I struggled with a few things while making this, 
mainly learning how to add javascript, realizing that text inside sugarcube script is structured differently than in the passage, and having to build in order to really check if things looked right visually. It was
overall a pretty tedious process.
