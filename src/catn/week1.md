##### Brainstorming

After doing the readings, a bunch of ideas were popping out at me in regards to how I should approach this assignment. 
I personally use Tarot Cards as a way to make sense of my life when I'm feeling lost. I don't necessarily believe that they have a mystical power, but 
I do think they can help illuminate patterns or assist in creating connections which that you didn't see before (although that is my own belief, and others do not have to agree with it).
Also, Tarot has a <a target="_blank" src="https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2022/02/the-tarot-narrative-therapy-self-making.html">rich history</a> and is already its own system for storytelling and 
meaning making. 

<br>

Before the readings, I had a couple ideas going into the prototype, such as having multiple players, strict rules for how to play cards, and specific written out descriptions assigned to every card. 
Ultimately, I didn't like that and that's not how I'd like to approach story telling. This was cemented by the Jesper Juul reading/game, from which my big takeaway 
was that the definition of reality is up to interpretation and the rules/context of the world you're building. In that reading, Juul quotes
Roland Barthes and the sentiment was that details make reality. This may be roundabout, but if my favorite part of tarot is that my interpretation is my own and I can come up with 
the details I think make sense, then why would I want a story generator which creates the reality and details for you?? I would rather have something that 
encourages idea generation with guiding themes concepts that I can manipulate myself. 

<br>

So rather than creating a story generator exactly, I decided to make a story <i>outline</i> generator, which 
can be used as a tool for story making. 

<br>

##### Goals

I wanted to make sure that the important aspects of a story are accounted for, but the method is easily tailored to the user's needs. 
Tarot cards already have meanings attached to them, which can work together across cards in interesting ways. The Major Arcana are meant to be 
overarching and have powerful meaning, while the Minor Arcana focus on day to day emotions, desires, and action/reaction to events. 

<br>

In my mind, stories require a character with motivations, a beginning, an ending, and a varying number of action/reaction combinations. 
I thought saying 'conflict' would be too vague, because how are we defining conflict? What if I don't want conflict, but just want to tell a story with a flow of events? 
I'm thinking about, specifically as an example, fluff romance fanfictions which don't necessarily have an overarching conflict. So in this generator, 
I didn't want to imply that conflict was entirely necessary. 

<br>

I developed a spread with rules, guidelines, and contextualizing questions which the user can user to come up with a story outline. 

<br>

##### Execution

In the spread, you select one or more Major Arcana to contextualize your story. This could be for the overarching theme or worldbuilding.
Then, from the face cards of the Minor Arcana (page, knight, queen, and king), you pick your characters. You have the option to choose as many characters as you like, or add more as the plot
progresses to meet your interpretive needs. The suits in combination with the card type will determine your character's motivations and personality. You can pick the characters and worldbuilding/themes randomly 
or choose specific ones for your taste. 

<br>

For the story itself, you will randomly choose a Major Arcana for the beginning, change of pace (optional), and ending. Keep in mind orientation can change the meaning of the card.
