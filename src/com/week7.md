##### Reflection

I had two ideas. One was a bit silly and probably done before, but it would be a synth that lets you choose the instrument
for each note. I don't think it would useful per se, but it would be fun to play with. My other idea 
would be this cube that you could interact with, and every side plays the same melody with different instrument. The volume would 
somehow be mapped so that each sample is playing with a volume proportional to how much of the cube face you can see. So if you rotate the cube and you 
can see 3 faces, then you'll hear 3 samples at equal volume. If you can only see 1 face, you'd only hear one sample at its highest volume. Maybe the environment would 
change accordingly as well.
