I was thinking about the type-drummer, and I thought what if it was a type-piano. I also wanted to incorporate effect mapping to the canvas like I did previously. 
I came to the idea of draggable sticky notes that be their own module. You can control the volume and playback of each note and move it around for a different effect. Some things
I didn't get to were an overall play/pause button, better styling, and maybe a way to change the speed or quantize the playback.
