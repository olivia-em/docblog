Justin and I wanted to do a loop launcher that had the ability to record vocal loops as well. For the visualization, I made this
<a target="_blank" href="https://olivia-em.github.io/codeyourway/preLoader/index.html">preLoader</a> for another class and wanted the
mixer to have a similar visual style. I wanted a layered visual, similar to turning gears, where each shape was assigned to a set of loops.
I used the code for the <a target="_blank" href="https://editor.p5js.org/luisa_NYU/sketches/uDhMc-dhK">waveform circle</a> to get
the vocal loop represented by the dot circle. I used Chat GPT to get the sibling loops to both trigger the same shape, rather than have
a shape for each loop. Justin got the stems and the quantized vocals to work.

Keys 1-3 control one set of loops, while 8-0 control their siblings. The hitting the space bar starts and stops a recording from your computer's microphone.
