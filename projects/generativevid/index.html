    <h4>Brainstorming &amp; Working with AI</h4>
<p>Ok this project was a huge hurdle for me. I had a lot of ideas about where to go and what I thought AI could help me with.
I made a <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1CHVRG58A4EUSaQRIZiYXP?si=66019eb4ac9e4958">playlist</a> for inspiration.
However, I was kind of disappointed with what AI had to give me. I had gotten inspiration pictures from pinterest and wanted to see what it could
do with them. The videos that came out were bizarre, soulless, flat, or all three.</p>

<p>I had originally wanted to do something that took a person through someone's quasi-living instagram, where all the pictures would come to life.
I still wanted the video to retain aesthetic and artistry. I don't take the comedy route for projects very often, and I wasn't confident doing that here.
I wouldn't say that artistry and depth lend well to AI, and I was consistently unhappy with the content I creating. I used all 2,500ish credits for text-to-image generation in Runway
and I didn't use a single one of those images in my final project.
<br><br></p>
<p>I decided I wanted to do a cross between poetry and AI art, either using my own poetry or some writers I like. My poetry
can be a bit gruesome, so I ended up not going that way, especially because AI doesn't do gore very well (and it probably wouldn't go over well in class).
I remembered a favorite free-verse poetry book, where the author details these monstrous images that appear in her mind; she calls them the <i>Nudes</i>, which
are not in any way pornographic, but often quite gruesome. I thought this would be a cool way to provide the text-to-art generators a prompt. I switched over to Adobe Express, Firefly Image 3, and was able to provide
an image that would determine a consistent style. This is why my collection of images is as stylistically consistent as they are; I've attached them below.</p>

<h4>Editing</h4>
<p>I wanted to basically put the book on the page. I took some excerpts and then replaced those Nude descriptions with the corresponding AI images. I chose the instrumental of a song I really like
and focused on clear text, little-to-no showy effects, and clear music-to-visuals timing.</p>
