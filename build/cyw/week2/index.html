<p>For this sketch, I had a pretty good idea of what it would look like initially. Or rather, conceptually I understood
how the randomness would change the positioning slightly. I wasn't sure how much overlap there would be exactly, but I knew it
would be there. Initially I thought this sketch would have the limits of the range increasing with the width
of the squares, but that wasn't the case. So, for my edits, I made it that way. I also added random color and made it a circle instead of
a square.</p>

<p>Similarly, I knew what this one was going to look like mostly. My sketch isn't as accurate as my description in the notes.
For my edits, I wanted more of the rectangles to be vertical, so I changed the if-statement. I also added an ellipse on top and
random color.</p>

<p>OKAY, so this one got a little crazy. I spent WAY too much time on it. I new what it was going to look like sort of. I thought there would
be more of a padding, but then I realized only the starting points were limited, rather than the end points as well. I initially changed the lines
to multiple <a target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/curveVertex/">curves</a>. Then, I wanted the padding to shaped them into a circle like
a ball of yarn. After adding fill, I noticed it was looking like a kaleidoscope, so I tried to replicate that by using <a target="_blank" href="https://editor.p5js.org/allison.parrish/sketches/kOHWUvQR1">mask image</a>
to mask the pattern into a circle. I added rotation and saw that once I duplicated it over top, it really looked like a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>I tried to move quicker on this one after the last one. I knew what it would look like and decided to have all the start
points be in the center. After messing with blending modes, I think it looks like lasers.</p>

<p>So for this one, I understood conceptually what was happening, but I didn't realize the lines draw would be
so much smaller. Therefore, I didn't realize the line would be very smooth. I added noise to change the color.
However, I don't fully understand why the gradient seems to be across the canvas rather than following the line. I thought it looked cool;
a happy accident.</p>

<p>Doing this assignment was really tough because noise is so hard on my computing power. I accidentally made my app storage overload
because I had it looping in a non-optimized fashion. I also wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. I want to get into glitch art
so I thought I could have noise change a bunch of grid squares, like pixels. But, I kinda got lost in the sauce
for a while, and nothing I did really made me happy. I ended up with this; not really sure how I got here. I just kept changing variables and
adding functions until I thought it looked cool.</p>
