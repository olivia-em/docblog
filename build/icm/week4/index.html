    <h4>Creating a <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/oliviaemlee/sketches/4mGfqYalI">patternMaker</a></h4>
<p>This assignment was really interesting for me, because it was less about getting to see exactly what I wanted and more about discovering
something cool through experimentation and the ways small changes could affect the bigger picture. I had messsed around with a couple ideas,
like a puzzle that pieced itself together. I remember learning about tessellation in fourth grade, and I wanted to do some thing like that. However,
a lot of tessellation is very fixed, and in the process of creating it, you as the creator kind of know exactly what you're going to get. And, I wanted
to be just as surprised as someone who just came across my code.
<br><br>
So then I thought, what if I had the same type of shape across many cells, but the oritentation was random and constantly changing, along with
style properties like color. This way, the pattern would be new. I started off by just designing my intital shape in the center of the screen, a square with
a circle and quarter circle inside. I then put it into a for loop, where every four iterations the square would have a different orientation. I struggled with this part a lot,
and had to ask for help. Using <i>translate</i> was a bit difficult because it was sort affecting the grid as a whole, rather than individual squares. When David (professor, thank you!) sent me
some edited code, it was super helpful. In reality, it wasn't exactly what I had wanted, but I was ok with that because this project was about surprising myself
with results that made me happy. After situating that, I added random color pallettes and also made it so that people could change the framerate or grid size easily at the top
of the code. I also though it would cute to have a save button if someone really liked one. That isn't super difficult code, and I found someone's documentation for that to help. Overall, super happy
with this project, especially that aha feeling when a pattern you particularly like pops up on the screen.</p>
