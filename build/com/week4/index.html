<p>I've wanted to make a drum pad ever since a classmate made one in ICM last semester. I modeled mine after
<a target="_blank" href="https://coral-feverfew-6ba.notion.site/Sound-1413c51e8cc7804c97a6da84524fadd3">his</a>, but made it compatible with tone.js.
I added a slider to change BPM, which also changes the color scheme of the drumpad, with cool tones for slower beats and warm tones for faster ones. I recorded
the sounds from different kits / instruments in Ableton. I had to run the MP3s back through to fix the FFTs from making the sounds cut off abruptly. I did it in a bit of janky way, however
and I'd like to learn the proper way to export, for example a smooth sounding 16th note. I was struggling with structuring the interface, so that it
adapted correctly to the window. The was a lot of math and tinkering involved in that, but it was good practice. The interface is simpler than I wanted; my next step would have been to add reverb &amp; delay (I'll probably do that later).
Also, even though this was an exploration of rhythm, when I was choosing synthy notes for the pad, I wasn't sure what would be good together. If I was to get really fancy, I'd like to be able to change note lenghths, but I'm not
sure where to begin with that.</p>
<p>The video above is me playing with it. In that clip, I don't think I messed with the BPM but I recorded myself for about 6 minutes. Functionally, the BPM won't update until the slider is released, so it isn't changing gradually, and I think
it would be nicer if it did.</p>
